# Streamlit Calculator

This is a simple calculator app built with Streamlit. It was created as part of my learning process to understand Streamlit basics and how to deploy a Streamlit app. The app uses a textarea input field to process mathematical expressions and perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Deployed App

You can check out the live deployed app here:  
[Streamlit Calculator](https://noobgrinder-calculator.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Utilizes a textarea input field for user input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.x+
- Any modern web browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd streamlit-calculator
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to use the calculator.

3. Enter a mathematical expression into the textarea (e.g., `5 + 3`, `10 - 4`, `6 * 7`, `20 / 4`), and the result will be displayed.

## Learning Experience

This app was my first Streamlit project, and through building it, I learned:

- The basics of Streamlit and how to create interactive web apps.
- How to deploy a Streamlit app to a live environment for others to use.

## Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Edit `Calculator.py` to add new features or make modifications.
